# 🙏 Namaskar! I'm Yash Agrawal

🚀 Business-First Developer | 🌐 Full-Stack Problem Solver | 🎨 Design-Led Thinker | ☁️ Cloud & AI Explorer

---

I’m a full-stack developer with a passion for blending **technology**, **design**, and **strategy** to solve real-world digital problems. I work independently with startups, brands, and agencies to build websites, internal tools, and digital experiences that are smart, scalable, and business-ready.

My journey began in school with a curiosity about how things work behind the scenes. That curiosity turned into a deep passion for creating systems that are clean, functional, and meaningful. Today, I focus on delivering solutions that not only look great but help businesses grow with clarity and confidence.
